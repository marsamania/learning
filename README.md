12/11/18 - Mocha successfully installed for project only using the below commands (also installed chai)  
$```npm install --save-dev mocha```  
$```npm install --save-dev chai```

Also created package.json file using  
```npm init```

This enabled me to use   
$```npm test```  
instead of  
$```./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha```  

Also learned some Markdown for making code snippets and line breaks (2 spaces before the thing you want on new line)
